This code allows you to calculate the child's play accessibility metric: calculating the ease with which children can reach places for play in the city, without supervision. The child's play accessibility metric takes into account how children may play not only in playgrounds, but also in informal play space such as schoolyards and small greenspaces. Furthermore, it accounts for (perceived) barriers that may exist for children in the city, such as busy roads, railways, and large natural environments. We recommend complementing our child's play accessibility metric with field work and collecting knowledge of local people, to understand all local nuances that may affects children who wish to access places for play. 

The child's play accessibility metric was co-designed with experts on the built environment and children's health. 

This code is developed for three cities in Europe (i.e., Milan, Ljubljana, and Utrecht) and can be adapted to fit other geographical contexts.
